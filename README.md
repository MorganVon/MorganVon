## Welcome to My GitHub Pages

Hello, this is my gitgub page. There'll be some of my research with some coding file.

My Main Research is about option valuation and trading strategy. Welcome to comment. 

### Option Valuation

I'll make some very basic file about valuation of the Option Products, mainly about **Equity Vanilla options** and may add some **Exotic Options**.

These coding file will be updated:
1. Basic Vanilla Valuation Model;
2. Vanilla Option Greeks Valuation Model;
3. A Basic GUI about the Vanilla position controlling;
4. Exotic Option Valuation Model (Monte Carlo).

If Possible, these file will also be updated:
1. Currency Option Valuation Model;
2. Simple Volatilty Surface Mark Model;
3. Composite Mark System including Risk-Free Rates and Dividends.

### Option Trading Strategy

Some Basic Trading Strategy and make some Back Test with the Strategy.
Maily Using **Vanilla Options** because of the volume in many products is too low to make the strategy.

These Strategy will be updated:
1. Option Short Strategy;
2. Calender Spread Strategy;
